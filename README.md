# CustomerChurnRate
A machine learning model to predict whether the customer will churn or not in the next six months.
Reducing Customer Churn is a major objective for any firm. An additional possible source of income for every firm is the ability to predict customer churn, commonly referred to as customer attrition. The cost to the firm is impacted by customer churn. Increased customer churn results in revenue loss and higher marketing expenses because it takes longer to acquire new consumers. 
As a data scientist of a bank, you are asked to analyze the past data and predict whether the customer will churn or not in the next 6 months. This would help the bank to have the right engagement with customers at the right time.
